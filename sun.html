<h2> SUN- Ball of Fire </h2>
<p>Our Sun is a 4.5 billion-year-old yellow dwarf star,
    a hot glowing ball of hydrogen and helium at the center
    of our solar system. It's about 93 million miles
    (150 million kilometers) from Earth and it's our solar
    system's only star. Without the Sun's energy, life as
    we know it could not exist on our home planet.
    It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth.</p>
